# Journal Of Digital History Peer Review policy

(based on: https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/peer-review/ethics-in-peer-review)

The Journal of Digital History follows a single-blind peer-review policy, meaning that reviewer knows the name of author(s) of article they review, but that authors do not know their article's reviewers.

This document is aimed at peer reviewers, to promote ethical review practices. The aim is to publish articles based on rigorous and ethically sound research.

## Conflicts of interest

Imspired by [Cambridge University Press](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/peer-review/ethics-in-peer-review) ethics in peer review document, we define a conflict interest as

> anything that affects or has the potential to affect peer reviewer's ability to review an article solely on the basis of academic merit. Even if you feel able to review the content with integrity, it is essential that you declare anything that could be considered a conflict of interest to the relevant editor.

In case of potential conflict of interest, reviewer should contact the [managing editor](mailto:jdh.admin@uni.lu). The ditorial team will then discuss this conflict of interest and see if there are possibilities to mitigate its influence.

The cornerstone of a sound peer review is hence transparency from potential reviewers, as well as from the editorial team. Both will share their views on conflicts of interest.

There are many examples of conflicts of interests. Here are some examples:

- a personnal or professional relationship with the authro(s);
- the article is focusing on a research subject that is close to an article or a book that the reviewer is working on;
- any financial interest linked to the result of the review.

Reviewers might not see immediatly a conflict of interest, that can become aparent at any point of the review process. Reviewers are hence invited to contact the managing editor as soon as the conflict of interest becomes obvious.


## Bias

There are many occasion where (unconscious) biases can be ntroduced in the peer review process. As the Journal of Digital History peer review policy is single blind, all reviewers should asked themselves if knowing the author(s), if their gender or origins, might influence the result of the peer review process. To avoid biases in your review, basing all your affirmation / arguments on arguments made in the paper is key. 

## Confidentiality

The editorial team will ensure that the authors do not identify their peer reviewers. The editorial teams will also ask the authors not to try guessing who are their peer reviewers.

Peer reviewers should be careful when they write their review and should avoid putting in there any elements that can help authors identifying them. 

Furthermore, papers as long as they are not published, are confidential documents, as well as reviews. Peer reviewers should refrain from actions that might lead to a confidentiality breach: talking to someone else about the article and its review or submitting it to a chatbot, for instance.

Reviewers should not ask someone else to write the review on their behalf.

## Quality and efficiency

Timely reviews are keys to a fluid publication process. When they accept to review a paper, reviewers clearly communicate with the editor about the time they will need to write the review. If a reviewer -- whatever the reason -- realises that they will not be able to send their review on time, they should declare it to the editor as soon as possible. The editor will then decide if it is possible or not to grant an extension to the reviewer. The JDH editorial team understands that quality review requires time.

Though reviewers can send a confidential comment to the editors, the whole review should be written respecting the most respectfull way. One way to write respectfully, even if the modification asked for are important, even if the reviewer think that the article should be rejected, is to imagine that the review could be published. 

A review should be written following the idea that it is made to improve the quality of the author(s)'s research. Though quality reviews are especially important for young researchers, they will be of interest at all stage of a research career.

All element of the review should be grounded in evidence from the article reviewed. It should be detailed and constructive.

## If reviewers are concerned about author or editor misconduct

In case a reviewer is concerned with an author misconduct (plagiarism, fabricated evidences, etc), they should report it to the managing editor.

In case a reviewer is concerned about a potential editor's misconduct, they should report it to the editor-in-chief.


The Journal of Digital History team, at the C2DH as well as at De Gruyter, is conscious that your work as reviewers is of crucial importance to make the JDH's articles better. And we thank all reviewers -- past, present and future -- for their work.
